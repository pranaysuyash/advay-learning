## Critical Issues (Fix Before Launch)

### 🔴 P0 - Demo Blockers

#### 1. TypeScript Compilation Errors (historical, now resolved)

**Current status (2026-02-23)**: ✅ `npm run type-check` passes on current branch  
**Note**: The previously listed 10 TypeScript issues were from an earlier snapshot and are no longer reproducible in current frontend checks.

#### 2. Incomplete Input Method Coverage

**Impact**: Inconsistent UX across games

**Current State**:

- Mode A (Button Toggle): ✅ 2/4 games (AlphabetGame, ConnectTheDots)
- Mode B (Pinch): ✅ 2/4 games (AlphabetGame, ConnectTheDots)
- Mode C (Dwell): ❌ 0/4 games
- Mode D (Two-handed): ❌ 0/4 games
- FingerNumberShow: ❓ Unknown Mode A/B status
- LetterHunt: ❓ Unknown Mode A/B status

**Fix Effort**: 4-8 hours (audit + implement)
**Priority**: High - affects "works consistently" perception

#### 3. Camera Permission UX Gaps

**Impact**: First-time user drop-off

**Missing**:

- Clear onboarding for camera permissions
- Recovery flow when camera denied then enabled
- Visual tutorial showing hand tracking

**Fix Effort**: 2-4 hours
**Priority**: High - critical for demo videos

---

### 🟡 P1 - Polish Issues

#### 1. "AI Giveaway" Visual Styling

**Evidence**: RESEARCH-015-LAUNCH-HITLIST.md identifies "purple gradient" problem

**Issues**:

- Excessive use of gradients (bg-gradient-to-\*)
- Inconsistent with BRAND_KIT.md tokens
- Feels like "AI demo" not "polished product"

**Fix Effort**: 4-8 hours (systematic brand application)
**Priority**: Medium - affects perceived quality

#### 2. Camera Overlay Overload

**Evidence**: Camera game UX audits identify overlay issues

**Issue**: Camera feed sometimes <70% of screen during active play
**Impact**: Core value prop ("camera-first") undermined

**Fix Effort**: 2-4 hours (UI cleanup)
**Priority**: Medium - critical for camera game demos

#### 3. Progress Tracking Gaps

**Evidence**: TODO comments in Dashboard.tsx

**Missing**:

- FingerNumberShow progress tracking
- Unified analytics implementation
- Cross-game progress coherence

**Fix Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Priority**: Low for demo, High for launch

#### 4. Finger Counting Edge Cases

**Evidence**: RESEARCH-015 hitlist item #5

**Issues**:

- 0 fingers (closed fist) detection
- 10 fingers (two hands) sum
- Thumb visibility edge cases

**Fix Effort**: 2-4 hours (algorithm tuning)
**Priority**: Medium - affects "it works" perception

---

### 🟢 P2 - Nice-to-Have

1. **Audio Assets**: Letter pronunciation audio files (Phase 1 at 70%)
2. **Mode C/D Implementation**: Dwell and Two-handed controls
3. **Touch Gesture Enhancement**: Better mobile support
4. **Performance Profiling**: FPS/CPU metrics on target devices
5. **Email Service Setup**: Production email provider (SendGrid/SES)

>
> Using MediaPipe hand tracking, kids can learn letters, numbers, and shapes through natural hand gestures - no mouse or keyboard needed.
>
> Just added camera controls to the Connect the Dots game! Kids can point with their index finger and pinch to connect dots.
>
> Tech stack: MediaPipe for CV, React + TypeScript, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL.
>
> Early beta demo - feedback welcome! 🙌
>
> [Video/GIF showing hand tracking]

## Update (2026-02-23 13:15 IST) - Current Branch Reality Check

`Observed` on current branch:
- Frontend type-check passes: `cd src/frontend && npm run -s type-check`
- Frontend lint passes: `cd src/frontend && npm run -s lint`
- Targeted P0 test suites pass (worker protocol/runtime mode, camera error boundary, image helper, and smoke routes)

`Observed` additional pilot implementation:
- EmojiMatch now uses a feature-flag-aware cursor embodiment path (`CursorEmbodiment`) with soft cartoon hand support and dot fallback.

This update supersedes any stale blocker phrasing that implied active TypeScript/lint failures at this snapshot.
