# Age Bands & Defaults

This document centralizes recommended defaults by age group. These defaults should be overridden by observed performance when needed.

## Age 3–4 (Pre-K)

**Primary goal**: confidence + control (pre-writing)

Recommended defaults:

- Session length: 3–6 minutes
- New items per session: 1
- Practice items per session: 1–2
- Hints: ON (high opacity)
- Stroke tolerance: high (thicker line)
- Auto-advance: after success (short delay)
- Control mode: Button Toggle (large buttons)

Recommended activities:

- Line/circle tracing mini-games
- Large letter tracing with guide circle
- Creative Studio: free draw with big brushes and 2–3 colors
- Pattern play: simple symmetry (mirror drawing)
- Face + Body Play (optional): stickers/overlays only, short sessions
- Numbers: counting objects 1–10, number tracing 0–3
- Puzzles: 2–6 piece “fit the shape”, simple matching

Stop conditions:

- 2 minutes without improvement → simplify or switch activity
- 3 failed checks in a row → show stronger guide or allow skip

## Age 5–6 (K–1)

**Primary goal**: letter formation + recognition

Recommended defaults:

- Session length: 6–10 minutes
- New items per session: 1–2
- Practice items per session: 2–4
- Hints: ON by default; fade after first few seconds
- Stroke tolerance: medium
- Control mode: Button Toggle or Pinch (if stable)

Recommended activities:

- Letter tracing with decreasing guide
- “Find the letter” recognition rounds
- Creative Studio: “draw from clues” (2–4 constraints)
- Thinking games: odd-one-out, sequencing (3 steps)
- Numbers: counting 1–20, number tracing 0–9, dot-pattern matching
- Puzzles: mazes (very easy), pattern completion (AB/AAB)

Stop conditions:

- 4 low attempts in a row → drop difficulty and increase hints

## Age 7–8 (2–3)

**Primary goal**: fluency + transfer (memory and phonics)

Recommended defaults:

- Session length: 8–12 minutes
- New items per session: 2–3
- Practice items per session: 3–5
- Hints: OFF by default; user-toggleable
- Stroke tolerance: lower
- Control mode: Pinch or Dwell (optional)

Recommended activities:

- Copy-from-memory tracing (show then hide)
- Simple phonics mini-games (optional)
- Creative Studio: shape builder challenges
- Thinking games: mazes + simple logic (IF/THEN icons)
- STEM play: sort/measure mini-games
- Numbers: compare more/less, add/remove objects, patterns/sequences (ABC)
- Puzzles: tangram-lite, rotate-and-place, missing-piece patterns

Stop conditions:

- If speed increases while accuracy drops → reduce time pressure

## Age 9+ (Optional)

**Primary goal**: enrichment + multilingual practice

Recommended defaults:

- Session length: 10–15 minutes
- New items per session: 3+
- Hints: OFF by default
- Add optional challenges (speed runs, accuracy targets)
- Add “project mode” (multi-step creative tasks)
- Add “brain games” rotation (logic + numeracy + spatial)

## Accessibility & Variability

These should be supported at any age:

- Left-handed mode (mirroring and control placement)
- Color-blind friendly palette options
- “Extra guidance” mode (always-on hints, thicker lines)
- “Low stimulation” mode (reduce animations/sounds)
- Parent toggle for camera-based modules
