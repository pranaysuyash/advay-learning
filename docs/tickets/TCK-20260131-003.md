# Title: Child Usability Enhancements

Type: FEATURE/REMEDIATION
Owner: AI Assistant
Created: 2026-01-31 00:00 UTC
Status: OPEN
Priority: P1 (High - Child-Centered UX)

Scope contract:

- In-scope:
  - Implement age-appropriate UI for 4-6 year olds
  - Add better visual feedback for younger children (2-3 years)
  - Implement simpler gesture mode for toddlers (wave to start vs pinch)
  - Add clearer visual feedback on where finger is vs where line is
  - Implement bronze star rating for 40-60% accuracy (not just "Try Again")
  - Add "Almost there!" feedback with visual hint of missing areas
  - Improve visual cues for hand detection vs drawing mode
- Out-of-scope:
  - Complete game redesign
  - New game modes beyond letter tracing
  - Backend changes
- Behavior change allowed: YES (UX improvements for children)

Targets:

- Repo: learning_for_kids
- Files to modify:
  - src/frontend/src/pages/Game.tsx (improve feedback, add wave mode, enhance visual cues)
  - src/frontend/src/components/Mascot.tsx (add more encouraging messages for younger kids)
  - src/frontend/src/data/pipResponses.ts (add bronze star messages, "almost there" messages)
  - Branch: main
- Git availability: YES

Related Audit Findings:

1. **child_usability_audit.md** - Age-appropriate UI needs
2. **child_usability_audit.md** - Younger children (2-3 years) need simpler interactions
3. **ux_feedback_v1.md** - Kid A (2-3 years) needs "Wave to start" mode
4. **ux_feedback_v1.md** - Kid B (4-6 years) wants stars instead of red "Try Again"
5. **ux_feedback_v1.md** - Need clearer visual feedback on finger position vs drawing

Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Mascot displays simpler messages for younger children (2-3 years)
- [ ] Bronze star (⭐) awarded for 40-60% accuracy (not just "Try Again")
- [ ] "Almost there!" or "Close!" feedback when near target (60-69%)
- [ ] Visual highlight shows where user missed (gap in tracing)
- [ ] Optional "Wave to start" mode for toddlers (easier than pinch)
- [ ] Cursor shows clearly if in drawing mode vs just tracking
- [ ] Larger hit targets for younger children
- [ ] Clearer feedback on where finger is vs where line is being drawn
- [ ] All age groups (4-6 years) have appropriate difficulty/feedback
- [ ] No performance regression (maintain 25+ FPS)

Dependencies:

- None (can proceed independently)

Execution log:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Created ticket | Status: OPEN
- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Reviewed child_usability_audit.md findings
- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Reviewed ux_feedback_v1.md findings
- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Checked worklog for existing tickets - none found

Status updates:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] OPEN - Ready for implementation

Next actions:

1. Update pipResponses.ts with bronze star messages for 40-60% accuracy
2. Add "Almost there!" messages for 60-69% accuracy
3. Implement visual gap highlight (show where tracing missed)
4. Add cursor state indicator (drawing vs tracking mode)
5. Implement optional "Wave to start" mode for toddlers
6. Update Mascot messages for age-appropriate language
7. Test with 2-3 year old user personas
8. Test with 4-6 year old user personas
9. Verify visual clarity of feedback cues

Risks/notes:

- Younger children (2-3 years) may struggle with pinch gesture
- "Try Again" feedback can be discouraging for children
- Visual feedback on finger position vs drawing is unclear
- Age-appropriate language requires careful testing with actual children

Evidence:

- **Audit References**:
  - docs/audit/child_usability_audit.md
  - docs/audit/ux_feedback_v1.md (lines 72-73)
- **Command**: `grep -n "bronze.*star\|almost.*there" docs/WORKLOG_TICKETS.md`
- **Output**: No existing tickets found for these issues
- **Code Review**:
  - Game.tsx: Feedback system exists (accuracy-based messages)
  - Mascot.tsx: Message display logic exists
  - pipResponses.ts: Response templates exist
