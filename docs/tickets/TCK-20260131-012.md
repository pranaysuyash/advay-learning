Related Audit Findings:

1. **ui__src__frontend__src__pages__Dashboard.tsx.md** - Issue #3 (Icons without ARIA labels)
2. **DASHBOARD_USER_REVIEW.md** - User review found icons confusing
3. **ui_design_audit.md** - Missing Alt Text (for icons)

Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Letters icon has aria-label="Letters learned"
- [ ] Target icon has aria-label="Target accuracy goal"
- [ ] Timer icon has aria-label="Time spent learning"
- [ ] Flame icon has aria-label="Current streak of days played"
- [ ] Check icon has aria-label (when displayed)

- [ ] All aria-hidden="true" removed from icon elements
- [ ] Icons remain visible in UI (not hidden from screen readers)
- [ ] Screen reader announces icon labels when they gain focus
- [ ] All icons have semantic, descriptive labels
- [ ] No WCAG 2.1 ARIA violations for icons
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No new ESLint errors
- [ ] Tested with screen reader (VoiceOver or NVDA)

Dependencies:

- None (can proceed independently)

Execution log:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Created ticket | Status: OPEN
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] User persona review completed
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] Identified icons without ARIA labels
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] User feedback: "I see icons but I don't know what they represent. As a regular user I can't tell. If I needed to explain this to someone (like a babysitter or grandparent), I couldn't"
  - Impact: HIGH - Screen reader users completely blocked

- **Audit Reference**: docs/audit/ui__src__frontend__src__pages__Dashboard.tsx.md
  - Issue #3: Icons without ARIA labels
  - Lines 57, 36, 41, 50 all have aria-hidden="true"

- **Code Review**:

  ```tsx
  // Line 57
  <UIIcon name="letters" size={20} className="text-white/80" aria-hidden="true" />
  
  // Line 36
  <UIIcon name="target" size={20} className="text-white/80" aria-hidden="true" />
  
  // Line 41
  <UIIcon name="timer" size={20} className="text-white/80" aria-hidden="true" />
  
  // Line 50
  <UIIcon name="flame" size={20} className="text-white/80" aria-hidden="true" />
  ```

Status updates:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] OPEN - Ready for implementation

Next actions:

1. Add aria-label="Letters learned" to letters icon (line 57)
2. Add aria-label="Target accuracy goal" to target icon (line 36)
3. Add aria-label="Time spent learning" to timer icon (line 41)
4. Add aria-label="Current streak of days played" to flame icon (line 50)
5. Add aria-label to check icon when displaying accuracy badge
6. Add aria-label to circle icon when displaying progress
7. Remove aria-hidden="true" from all 5 icon instances
8. Test with VoiceOver (Mac) to verify announcements
9. Test with NVDA (Windows) to verify announcements
10. Update ui__src__frontend__src__pages__Dashboard.tsx.md audit with ticket reference
11. Update DASHBOARD_USER_REVIEW.md with ticket reference

Risks/notes:

- Icons are completely hidden from screen readers (aria-hidden)
- Screen reader users cannot understand the interface at all
- No semantic meaning conveyed by icons
- WCAG 2.1 ARIA violation - fails accessibility compliance
- Parents using screen readers would be blocked from using the app
- Compliance failure for accessibility standards

Evidence:

- **User Review**: docs/DASHBOARD_USER_REVIEW.md
  - Finding: Icons Don't Have Clear Meanings - Severity: HIGH
  - User feedback: "I see icons but I don't know what they represent"
  - Impact: "As a regular user I can't tell. If I needed to explain this to someone, I couldn't"
  - This applies even more strongly to screen reader users who rely on ARIA labels

- **Audit Reference**: docs/audit/ui__src__frontend__src__pages__Dashboard.tsx.md
  - Issue #3: Icons without ARIA labels
  - All 5 icons have aria-hidden="true"
  - Lines: 57, 36, 41, 50 (plus check icon and circle icon in progress section)
