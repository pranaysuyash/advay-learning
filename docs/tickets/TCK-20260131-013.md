Status: OPEN
Priority: P0 (High - Readability for All Users)

Scope contract:

- In-scope:
  - Increase main heading from `text-3xl` to `text-4xl` (24px to 36px)
  - Increase all secondary text from `p-6` to `text-base` (16px)
  - Increase greeting text from `p-6` to `text-lg` (18px)
  - Ensure WCAG AA contrast compliance (4.5:1 ratio)
  - Verify text is readable on mobile (min 16px for body)
  - Verify text is readable on tablet (min 18px for body)
  - Verify text is readable on desktop (min 16px for body)
  - Check contrast ratios meet WCAG AA for all text elements
  - Test across different lighting conditions (simulated)
  - Out-of-scope:
  - Complete typography system redesign
  - Add custom font files
  - Dark mode support (unless for accessibility)
  - Backend changes
  - Behavior change allowed: YES (improving readability)

Targets:

- Repo: learning_for_kids
- Files to modify:
  - src/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (all text elements)
  - src/frontend/tailwind.config.js (if custom font sizes needed)
  - Branch: main
  - Git availability: YES

- [ ] All text readable on mobile viewport (375px width, min 16px)
- [ ] All text readable on tablet viewport (768px width, min 16px)
- [ ] All text readable on desktop viewport (1280px width, min 16px)
- [ ] Contrast verified to meet WCAG AA for all text elements
- [ ] No accessibility regressions introduced
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No new ESLint errors

Execution log:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Created ticket | Status: OPEN
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] User persona review completed
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] User feedback: "I have to squint or hold my phone closer to read comfortably. As an older parent with declining eyesight, this is a real problem."
  - Impact: HIGH - Multiple users struggle with readability

- **Audit Reference**: docs/audit/ui__src__frontend__src__pages__Dashboard.tsx.md
  - Issue #2: Typography Too Small
  - Line 96: `<h1 className='text-3xl font-bold'>Parent Dashboard</h1>`
  - Line 97: `<p className='text-white/60 mt-1'>Welcome back...</p>`

- **WCAG Standards**:
  - Body text: minimum 16px (AA), 18px recommended (AAA)
  - Main heading: Should be 2.5x to 3x larger than body text
  - Contrast: minimum 4.5:1 for normal text

Status updates:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] OPEN - Ready for implementation

Next actions:

1. Increase main heading from text-3xl to text-4xl (36px)
2. Increase all secondary text from p-6 to text-base (16px)
3. Increase greeting text from p-6 to text-lg (18px)
4. Verify WCAG AA contrast for all text elements
5. Test on mobile viewport (375px width)
6. Test on tablet viewport (768px width)
7. Test on desktop viewport (1280px width)
8. Check contrast ratios in different lighting conditions
9. Update ui__src__frontend__src__pages__Dashboard.tsx.md audit with ticket reference
10. Update DASHBOARD_USER_REVIEW.md with ticket reference

Risks/notes:

- Text too small violates WCAG AA minimum (16px required, 16px found)
- Low contrast (text-white/60 = 60% white) fails WCAG AA (4.5:1 ratio)
- Parents with visual impairments cannot use the dashboard
- Kids struggle to read small text
- Aging parents with declining eyesight severely impacted
- Accessibility non-compliance for production

Evidence:

- **User Review**: docs/DASHBOARD_USER_REVIEW.md
  - Finding: Text is Too Small and Hard to Read - Severity: MEDIUM (raised to HIGH)
  - User quote: "I have to squint or hold my phone closer to read comfortably. As an older parent with declining eyesight, this is a real problem."
  - Impact: Multiple user groups affected

- **Audit Reference**: docs/audit/ui__src__frontend__src__pages__Dashboard.tsx.md
  - Issue #2: Typography Too Small
  - p-6 class used throughout (16px, below WCAG AA minimum)
  - text-white/60 class has poor contrast on light backgrounds

- **Code Review**:
  ```tsx
  // Line 96 - Main heading too small
  <h1 className='text-3xl font-bold'>Parent Dashboard</h1>
  
  // Line 97 - Secondary text too small
  <p className='text-white/60 mt-1'>Welcome back...</p>
  ```
