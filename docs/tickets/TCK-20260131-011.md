# Title: Dashboard Statistics - Make Meaningful and Clear

Type: REMEDIATION
Owner: AI Assistant
Created: 2026-01-31 00:00 UTC
Status: OPEN
Priority: P0 (High - Critical Parent Understanding)

Scope contract:

- In-scope:
  - Transform "Letters Learned: 5/26" to "5 of 26 letters"
  - Transform "Average Accuracy: 75%" to star rating display (⭐⭐⭐)
  - Add visual feedback for good performance (celebration message from mascot)
  - Add context to statistics so parents understand at a glance
  - Ensure all metrics have clear, kid-friendly labels
  - Test with actual parents to validate they can quickly understand progress
- Out-of-scope:
  - Change calculation logic (keep existing)
  - Add new statistics tracking (use existing data)
  - Backend changes to progress API
  - Behavior change allowed: YES (improving parent understanding)

Targets:

- Repo: learning_for_kids
- Files to modify:
  - src/frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx (stats display)
  - src/frontend/src/components/Mascot.tsx (add celebration support)
  - Branch: main
- Git availability: YES

2. **DASHBOARD_USER_REVIEW.md** - User persona review completed
3. **DASHBOARD_PERSONA_REVIEW.md** - User persona guide created

Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Letters Learned changed from "5/26" to "5 of 26 letters"
- [ ] Average Accuracy changed from "75%" to star rating (⭐⭐⭐)
- [ ] Time Spent changed from "2h 30m" to "About 2 hours"
- [ ] Celebration message added for good performance
- [ ] All statistics have helper text explaining what they mean
- [ ] Parents can understand at a glance if child is doing well
- [ ] No calculation errors in time or percentage displays
- [ ] Star rating system implemented (3 stars for 90%+, 2 stars for 70-89%, 1 star for 40-69%)
- [ ] Mascot shows encouraging message for high achievements
- [ ] Tested with actual parents
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No new ESLint errors

Dependencies:

- None (can proceed independently)

Execution log:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Created ticket | Status: OPEN
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] User persona review completed - DASHBOARD_USER_REVIEW.md
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] Identified statistics abstraction as #1 issue
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] User feedback: "I can't tell if my kids are doing well"
- [2026-01-31 00:30 UTC] User feedback: "I have to do mental math to understand what's happening"

Status updates:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] OPEN - Ready for implementation

Next actions:

1. Change stats.label from "Letters Learned" to "Letters"
2. Transform stats.value from fraction "5/26" to "X of Y" format
3. Implement star rating calculation based on accuracy percentage
4. Display star rating (⭐⭐⭐) alongside or instead of percentage for accuracy stat
5. Simplify time display from "2h 30m" to "About 2 hours"
6. Add helper text to statistics explaining what they mean
7. Add mascot celebration message when child achieves high accuracy (90%+)
8. Test with parents to validate they can quickly understand progress
9. Update audit docs with completion status

Risks/notes:

- Parents struggle to understand abstract statistics
- Percentages ("75%") don't convey "good" or "needs practice"
- Fractions ("5/26") require mental math
- Time format ("2h 30m") is harder to read quickly than "About 2 hours"
- Without clear indicators, parents may be unsure whether to celebrate or encourage
- Abstract metrics create anxiety about child's progress

Evidence:

- **User Review**: docs/DASHBOARD_USER_REVIEW.md
  - Finding: "Statistics are Too Abstract and Confusing"
  - User quote: "I have to do mental math to understand what's happening"
  - User quote: "I want to know immediately: Are my kids on track? Are they doing well? Do they need more practice?"
  - Impact: HIGH - Parents can't assess learning progress quickly

- **Audit Reference**: docs/audit/ui__src__frontend__src__pages__Dashboard.tsx.md
  - Issue #3: Statistics Display Abstraction
  - Lines 23-56: Stats array configuration

- **Code Review**:
  ```tsx
  // Current implementation
  label: 'Letters Learned',
  value: `${selectedChildData.progress.lettersLearned}/${selectedChildData.progress.totalLetters}`,
  
  label: 'Average Accuracy',
  value: `${selectedChildData.progress.averageAccuracy}%`,
  ```
