# Title: Fix Accessibility & Form Issues from UI Design Audit

Type: REMEDIATION
Owner: AI Assistant
Created: 2026-01-31 00:00 UTC
Status: OPEN
Priority: P1 (High - Accessibility Compliance)

Scope contract:

- In-scope:
  - Add autocomplete attributes to all form inputs (email, password, etc.)
  - Add password visibility toggle (show/hide password) to login and register forms
  - Implement proper error handling UI for failed form submissions
  - Add loading states to forms during async operations
  - Implement keyboard navigation improvements (focus management, tab order)
  - Add ARIA labels to emoji elements throughout the UI
  - Verify WCAG AA contrast compliance for all text elements
- Out-of-scope:
  - Complete redesign of authentication flows
  - Backend changes to API
  - Advanced accessibility features (screen reader optimizations)
- Behavior change allowed: YES (accessibility improvements)

Targets:

- Repo: learning_for_kids
- Files to modify:
  - src/frontend/src/pages/Login.tsx (add autocomplete, password toggle, error handling, loading states)
  - src/frontend/src/pages/Register.tsx (add autocomplete, password toggle, error handling, loading states)
  - src/frontend/src/components/ui/Button.tsx (verify button type attributes)
  - All pages with emoji usage (add aria-label attributes)
  - Branch: main
- Git availability: YES

Related Audit Findings:

1. **ui_design_audit.md** - HIGH: Accessibility Violation - Missing Autocomplete Attributes
2. **ui_design_audit.md** - HIGH: Missing Error Handling UI
3. **ui_design_audit.md** - HIGH: No Loading States
4. **ui_design_audit.md** - MEDIUM: Password Visibility Toggle Missing
5. **ui_design_audit.md** - MEDIUM: Client-Side Form Validation
6. **ui_design_audit.md** - MEDIUM: Keyboard Navigation
7. **ui_design_audit.md** - LOW: Missing Alt Text (for emojis)

Acceptance Criteria:

- [ ] Email inputs have autocomplete="email" attribute
- [ ] Password inputs have autocomplete="current-password" / "new-password" attributes
- [ ] All password fields have visibility toggle (eye icon)
- [ ] Login/Register forms show error messages on failed submission
- [ ] All forms show loading state during async operations (spinner or disabled button)
- [ ] Button elements have explicit type="button" or type="submit" attributes
- [ ] Emoji elements have aria-label attributes for screen readers
- [ ] Focus management works correctly (tab order, focus restoration)
- [ ] Keyboard-only users can navigate entire application
- [ ] All text meets WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 ratio for normal text)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] No new ESLint errors
- [ ] Tested with screen reader (verify semantic HTML)

Dependencies:

- None (can proceed independently)

Execution log:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Created ticket | Status: OPEN
- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Reviewed ui_design_audit.md findings
- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] Checked worklog for existing accessibility tickets - none found

Status updates:

- [2026-01-31 00:00 UTC] OPEN - Ready for implementation

Next actions:

1. Add autocomplete attributes to Login.tsx email and password fields
2. Add autocomplete attributes to Register.tsx email and password fields
3. Implement password visibility toggle component
4. Integrate password visibility toggle in Login and Register forms
5. Add error state display for failed authentication
6. Add loading state to form submit buttons
7. Add type="button" attributes to all button elements
8. Add aria-label attributes to emoji elements throughout UI
9. Test keyboard navigation (tab order, focus management)
10. Run automated accessibility check (axe-core or pa11y)
11. Update ui_design_audit.md with ticket reference and completion status

Risks/notes:

- Accessibility compliance is required for production
- Missing autocomplete attributes affect form usability
- Password visibility is a security/usability best practice
- Error handling affects user experience
- Loading states prevent confusion about app responsiveness

Evidence:

- **Audit Reference**: docs/audit/ui_design_audit.md (lines 28-50)
- **Command**: `grep -n "autocomplete\|password.*visibility" docs/WORKLOG_TICKETS.md`
- **Output**: No existing tickets found for these issues
- **Code Review**:
  - Login.tsx: Email and password inputs exist
  - Register.tsx: Email, password, confirm password inputs exist
  - Button.tsx: Generic button component exists
  - Multiple components use emoji without aria-labels
