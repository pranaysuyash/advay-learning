# Brand Decision: ADVAY — "Active Discovery Vision AI for Youth"

**Decision ID:** TCK-20260130-013
**Date:** 2026-01-30
**Owner:** AI Assistant

## Executive Summary

ADVAY's primary brand expression will be:

**ADVAY — Active Discovery Vision AI for Youth**

This formulation keeps the single-word brand (ADVAY) and uses the expanded phrase as a tagline and descriptive positioning for marketing, pitch decks, and early product copy.

## Decision Rationale (why this was chosen from the short-list)

We focused evaluation on three candidate approaches: **Active Discovery (A)**, **Adventures in Digital (B)**, and **Augmented Development (C)**. The final selection balances three priorities: child appeal, parent trust/clarity, and investor/technical credibility.

- **Active Discovery (Chosen)**
  - Strengths: High memorability, strong child-appeal (movement + discovery), clear product fit for gesture-driven learning, and good parent-facing messaging. Keeps technical credibility via the words "Vision" and "AI" without sounding overly technical.
  - Why it beats B & C: It's more balanced than **B** (which is warm and story-driven but less explicitly technical) and more approachable than **C** (which is investor-friendly but less child-centric).

- **Adventures in Digital (Alternate)**
  - Strengths: Warm, story-focused, excellent for child engagement and narrative-driven campaigns.
  - Limitations: Less immediately clear about the product's AI / computer vision core; weaker fit for investor / technical audiences.

- **Augmented Development (Alternate)**
  - Strengths: Very strong for investor and technical pitches; sounds scalable and cutting-edge.
  - Limitations: Less emotionally warm and potentially less memorable for parents/children.

## Product Fit & Cultural Fit

- The phrase "Active Discovery" maps directly to the core interaction model: gesture-driven, hands-on learning.
- The selection preserves the Sanskrit connection (ADVAY = "unique") and positions the brand as both culturally thoughtful and technically modern.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Docs & repo**: Add an explicit brand decision doc (`docs/BRAND_DECISION.md`) and update `docs/BRAND_NAMING_EXPLORATION.md` to include the decision rationale and link to this doc.
2. **Site & README**: Add the tagline to `README.md` and any marketing docs (`docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`, pitch deck) where appropriate.
3. **Design**: Request logo / visual direction work to reflect the tagline (type lockups, icon with Sanskrit "अ" optional).
4. **Legal / Ops**: Perform a trademark availability check in relevant categories and secure domain(s): `advaylearning.com` and `advay.app` if possible.
5. **Follow-ups**: Update brand guidelines, change social handles, and add tagline to onboarding materials and pitch decks.

## Files Changed / Evidence

- Created: `docs/BRAND_DECISION.md` (this file)
- Modified: `docs/BRAND_NAMING_EXPLORATION.md` (decision rationale appended)
- Modified: `README.md` (tagline added)
- Added Worklog ticket: `TCK-20260130-013` (see `docs/WORKLOG_TICKETS.md`)

If you'd like, I can now: (a) update `docs/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md` and the pitch deck, (b) run a quick trademark/domain availability check, or (c) create simple logo lockup suggestions in `assets/` for designer review. Which should I prioritize next?
