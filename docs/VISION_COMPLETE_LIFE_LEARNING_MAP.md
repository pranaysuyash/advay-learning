# Vision: Complete Life Learning Map

**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Purpose:** Map EVERY domain of human learning and life experience that can be digitized through computer vision — and identify what we cover, what we're missing, and what we should build.

---

## The Vision

> **Anything a human can learn by doing with their body in the physical world, we make available digitally through computer vision.**

This isn't an app with 20 games. This is a **platform for digitizing all physical learning** — for kids first, then everyone.

A child doesn't just learn ABCs. They learn to tie shoes, pour water, recognize emotions on faces, cross the street safely, brush their teeth, share toys, plant seeds, tell time, fold clothes, follow a recipe, apologize, clap a rhythm, throw a ball, and a thousand other things. ALL of these involve the body. ALL of these can be tracked by cameras.

An adult learns sign language, practices yoga, rehabilitates injuries, learns instruments, practices presentations, meditates, learns martial arts forms, practices surgery techniques. Same principle.
