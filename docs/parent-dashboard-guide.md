- **Age**: Age of your child (used to customize learning experiences)
- **Preferred Language**: The primary language used in learning games

## Viewing Progress Metrics

The dashboard displays three key metrics for your child's learning progress:

### Letters Learned

- Shows the number of letters your child has mastered out of the total available
- A progress bar visualizes the completion percentage
- Letters are considered "mastered" after achieving high accuracy consistently

### Accuracy

- Displays your child's average accuracy when tracing letters
- Represented with star ratings:
  - ⭐⭐⭐ (90%+): Excellent accuracy
  - ⭐⭐ (70-89%): Good accuracy
  - ⭐ (40-69%): Developing accuracy
  - ☆ (<40%): Needs practice

### Time Spent

- Tracks the approximate time your child has spent learning
- Calculated based on the number of practice sessions
- Helps you monitor engagement levels

## Multi-Language Tracking

### Language Progress Overview

- The "Multi-Language Progress" section shows how your child is doing in different languages
- Each language displays:
  - Number of letters learned vs. total letters
  - Average accuracy percentage
  - Estimated time spent practicing

### Benefits of Multi-Language Learning

- Switching between languages builds cognitive flexibility
- Reinforces letter recognition across different writing systems
- Enhances overall linguistic awareness

## Managing Settings

### Current Settings Display

The dashboard shows your child's current settings:

- **Primary Language**: The main language for learning games
- **Difficulty**: Current challenge level (Easy, Medium, Hard)
- **Time Limit**: Daily usage limits (if set)

### Changing Settings

- Visit the Settings page to adjust difficulty, language, or other preferences
- Changes will apply to future learning sessions

## Exporting Data

### Downloading Progress Reports

1. Click the "Export Data" button in the top-right corner
2. The system will generate a JSON file with your child's progress
3. The file will automatically download to your device
4. File name format: `learning-progress-[YYYY-MM-DD].json`

### Using Exported Data

- Track long-term development
- Import into other systems if needed
