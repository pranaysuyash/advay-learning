## THE PROMPT

```
# Universe Vision Mapping

You are performing a Universe Vision Mapping — a comprehensive analysis that maps a product/project against the COMPLETE universe of problems, use cases, users, and experiences it could serve. The goal is to reveal what the product IS vs what it COULD BE, and find the 95% of potential that's invisible when you're heads-down building.

## Phase 1: Understand the Core

First, deeply understand the product by answering:

1. **What is the core technology/capability?** (e.g., "camera-based hand tracking", "real-time data sync", "natural language processing", "marketplace matching")
2. **What is the current use case?** (e.g., "kids learning ABCs", "team project management", "food delivery")
3. **Who is the current user?** (e.g., "children 3-8", "enterprise teams", "urban consumers")
4. **What is the core interaction pattern?** (e.g., "gesture → visual feedback", "type → AI responds", "browse → order → receive")
5. **What are the technical constraints?** (e.g., "browser-only", "requires camera", "needs internet")

### Dimension Y: MEASUREMENT & SUCCESS METRICS SPECTRUM
Map how you know the product is ACTUALLY WORKING — not vanity metrics:

- **Engagement:** DAU/MAU, session length, sessions per week — but are they LEARNING or just clicking?
- **Learning outcomes:** Pre/post skill assessment, grade improvement, milestone achievement
- **Retention:** 1-day, 7-day, 30-day, 90-day retention — different from engagement
- **Satisfaction:** NPS, parent satisfaction, child asks to use it voluntarily
- **Behavioral change:** Does the child practice letters outside the app? Brush teeth better?
- **Developmental impact:** Motor skill improvement, attention span increase, emotional vocabulary growth
- **Accessibility reach:** % of users with disabilities who can complete core flows
- **Market penetration:** % of target demographic reached in each market
- **Revenue per user:** LTV, CAC, payback period, willingness to pay
- **Social impact:** Number of underserved children reached, skills unlocked for free

### Dimension Z: THE UNKNOWN — DIMENSIONS YOU DISCOVER
**This is the most important dimension.** The above A–Y framework is a starting point, NOT an exhaustive list.

As you perform this analysis, you WILL discover dimensions that don't fit neatly into A–Y. **You are expected to create new dimensions.** Examples of dimensions that might emerge:

- A dimension specific to your industry that no framework covers
- A philosophical dimension about the nature of the product's impact
- A technical dimension about infrastructure that shapes everything
- A political or geopolitical dimension affecting distribution
- A psychological dimension about how the product changes self-perception
- A dimension about the relationship between digital and physical that the product uniquely bridges

**Instructions for Dimension Z:**
1. When you encounter something that doesn't fit A–Y, DON'T force it into an existing dimension
2. Create a new Dimension (AA, AB, AC... or give it a descriptive name)
3. Map it with the same rigor as A–Y
4. Explain WHY this dimension matters and why the existing framework missed it
5. There is no upper limit on dimensions — if you find 10 new ones, add 10 new ones

**The goal is not to fill a template. The goal is to MAP REALITY. Reality doesn't fit in 26 boxes.**

## Phase 3: Coverage Analysis

For each sub-area identified in Phase 2, classify:

- ✅ **Built** — Implemented and working (2+ features)
- 🟡 **Touched** — 1 feature or surface-level coverage
- 🔵 **Planned** — In docs/roadmap but not built
- 🔴 **Blind spot** — Not conceived at all
- ⬛ **Out of scope** — Technically impossible or fundamentally misaligned

Create a summary:

```
Built:       ████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  X%
Touched:     ██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  X%
Planned:     ████████░░░░░░░░░░░░  X%
Blind spots: ████████████████████  X%
```

## Phase 4: Blind Spot Deep Dive

For each blind spot area:

1. **Name it** clearly
2. **Describe** what could exist there (1-2 sentences)
3. **Assess feasibility** given current tech (Easy/Medium/Hard/Requires new tech)
4. **Rate impact** (How many people would this matter to? How much would it matter?)
5. **Identify** if any competitor covers this

## Phase 5: Generate New Ideas

For each major blind spot, generate 2-3 concrete product ideas:

| # | Idea | Domain | How Current Tech Enables It | Feasibility | Impact |
|---|------|--------|-----------------------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | ... | ... | ... | Easy/Med/Hard | High/Med/Low |

## Phase 6: The Vision Statement

Based on everything above, articulate:

1. **Current reality** (1 sentence): "Today, [product] is a [X] for [Y] that does [Z]."
2. **True potential** (1 sentence): "At its fullest, [product] is a [X] for [Y] that [Z]."
3. **The gap** (1 sentence): "We've built X% of what's possible. The biggest untapped opportunity is [Z]."
4. **The next frontier** (top 3 areas to expand into, with rationale)

## Phase 7: Prioritized Roadmap Suggestions

Rank the top 10-20 new opportunities by:

| Priority | Opportunity | Why Now | Effort | Impact | Risk |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|--------|------|
| 1 | ... | ... | S/M/L | 1-5 | Low/Med/High |

Consider:
- What can be built with ZERO new technology (just new content/features)?
- What requires one new capability that unlocks many features?
- What's the "sign language moment" — something uniquely perfect for your technology that nobody else does?

## Output Format

Produce a single comprehensive markdown document with all phases. Use tables, status icons, and clear headers. Include:
- Executive summary (2 paragraphs max)
- The honest coverage percentage
- Domain-by-domain tables
- Your original ideas (minimum 20)
- Top 10 prioritized recommendations
- The vision statement
- A "what I might have missed" section (intellectual honesty)

## Key Principles

1. **Exhaustiveness over elegance.** Map MORE than seems reasonable. The value is in finding what's been overlooked.
2. **Honesty over optimism.** Don't inflate coverage. Partial is partial.
3. **Adjacency thinking.** The best opportunities are often one step away from what you already do.
4. **Technology-pull, not market-push.** Ask "what does our tech UNIQUELY enable?" not "what do competitors do?"
5. **The 95% rule.** Most products have built <5% of their true potential. Find the 95%.
6. **Beginner's mind.** Pretend you've never seen this product. What would a first-time user expect it to do?
7. **Cross-pollination.** Steal ideas from completely unrelated industries.
8. **The "my mom" test.** Could someone non-technical understand why each opportunity matters?
9. **Dimension completeness.** Don't skip dimensions. The business model dimension is as important as the user dimension. The accessibility dimension reveals entire excluded markets.
10. **Temporal thinking.** A product that works today might be irrelevant in 3 years. What's the 10-year version?
11. **Data as product.** The data your product generates is often more valuable than the product itself. Map it.
