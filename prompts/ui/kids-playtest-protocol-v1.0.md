# Kids Playtest Protocol (Lightweight, Ethical, Actionable) (v1.0)

## Purpose

Define a practical playtest plan for a kids learning UI that produces actionable UI/UX changes.

This is optimized for:

- Short sessions (10-20 minutes)
- Small samples (3-6 kids per age band)
- High signal notes (what confused them, what delighted them)

## Scope Contract (MUST FILL)

- In-scope:
  - One flow: (e.g., home -> game -> progress)
  - One age band: `3-5 | 6-8 | 9-12`
  - One device: `tablet | phone | desktop`
- Out-of-scope:
  - Formal IRB studies (use your org process if needed)
  - Collecting personal data beyond minimal notes

## Safety / Consent Checklist

- Parent consent obtained (and child assent where appropriate)
- No recording unless explicitly consented
- No identifying info in notes
- "Stop anytime" reminder

## Session Structure (script)

1) Warm-up (1-2 min)
   - "Show me how you would start."
2) Task 1 (3-5 min): Discover and start an activity
3) Task 2 (3-5 min): Complete one learning loop
4) Task 3 (3-5 min): Find progress/achievements and interpret them
5) Free play (2-5 min): "Do anything you want"
6) Wrap (1 min): "What was your favorite part? What was hard?"

## What to Observe (high-signal)

- Where they hesitate (>3 seconds)
- Mis-taps and backtracking loops
- Reading dependence (do they need an adult to read?)
- Emotional signals: frustration, delight, boredom
- Discovery behavior: what they try when stuck

## Notes Template (fill during session)

- Child age band:
- Device:
- Flow tested:
- Observations (timestamped):
- Confusions (top 3):
- Delights (top 3):
- "Would repeat" moment (yes/no + why):
- Parent feedback (optional, 1-2 bullets):

## Synthesis Template (after sessions)

- **Observed**: most common confusion
- **Inferred**: likely root cause (navigation, labeling, feedback, motor)
- Recommendations (ranked, smallest-first):
  - `PT-001` ...
  - `PT-002` ...
- Verification plan:
  - Before/after quick task completion rate (manual)
