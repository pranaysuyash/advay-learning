# Intent-First Content Philosophy v1.0

## "Write for the Reader, Not the Algorithm"

**Core Principle:** Before creating, updating, or removing content (copy, messaging, SEO content), investigate what the audience actually needs, how they search and consume information, and what actions you want them to take.

**Codebase-First Focus:** Update existing content before creating new. Build upon messaging that's already working.

---

## Universal Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Context Discovery

1. **Identify the content need** (new feature launch, SEO gap, user confusion, or conversion issue)
2. **Understand the audience** (who are they, what do they know, what do they need?)
3. **Research search and consumption patterns** (how do people find and engage with this type of content?)
4. **Analyze existing content performance** (what works, what doesn't, and why?)
5. **Review existing content** (what's already written that could be updated?)

### Phase 2: Intent Analysis

- What specific problem is the audience trying to solve?
- What action do we want them to take after reading this?
- How does this content fit into their journey or decision process?
- What misconceptions or objections might they have?
- **Can we update existing content instead of creating new?**

### Phase 3: Content Value Assessment

- **Audience Impact**: How many people need this information and how urgently?
- **Business Impact**: Effect on awareness, conversion, retention, or support efficiency
- **Content Effort**: Time to research, write, design, and maintain
- **Competition Gap**: How well does existing content serve this need?
- **Existing Content Fit**: Can we enhance what's already there?

## Quick Filter

Skip detailed content creation if all true:

- Very small audience with minimal business impact
- Existing content already serves this need well
- High effort required for minimal incremental value
- Content would become outdated quickly without ongoing maintenance
- **Existing content could be updated instead**

## Content Priority Matrix

| Audience Impact | Business Impact | Content Effort | Existing Content | Priority |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|------------------|----------|
| High | High | Low-Medium | Needs Update | **Critical – Update immediately** |
| High | Medium | Low-Medium | Needs Update | **High – Update this sprint** |
| Medium | High | Low | Needs Update | **Medium – Plan for next iteration** |
| High | High | High | None | **Create new content** |
| High | High | Any | Strong | **Verify existing, minor updates if needed** |
| Low | Low | Any | Any | **Skip or create minimal reference** |

---

## Codebase-First Content Rule

For *Critical* and *High* priority content:

1. **Update before creating new** - enhance existing content where possible
2. **Build on what works** - extend messaging that's performing well
3. **Repurpose successful content** - adapt high-performing content for new uses
4. **Maintain consistency** - ensure tone and messaging align
5. **Measure performance** - track what content actually achieves

Advanced features like comprehensive examples, detailed case studies, or extensive SEO optimization can be added iteratively based on performance data.
