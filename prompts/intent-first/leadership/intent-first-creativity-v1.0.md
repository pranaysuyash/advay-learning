# Intent-First Creativity v1.0

## "Create for Meaning, Not Noise"

**Core Principle:** Anchor creative work to a target emotion, message, or experience, then iterate with constraints.

**Codebase-First Focus:** Build on existing creative assets and brand elements. Extend current visual language before creating new patterns.

## Universal Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Context Discovery

1. **Define the situation and stakeholders**
2. **Gather signals, history, and constraints**
3. **Surface hidden incentives and risks**
4. **Review existing creative assets** (what's already been created?)

### Phase 2: Intent Analysis

- What outcome are we truly optimizing for?
- Which principles must not be violated?
- What trade-offs are acceptable?
- **What existing creative assets can we build upon?**

### Phase 3: Priority Assessment

- **Impact**: magnitude of upside or avoided downside
- **Effort**: time, energy, attention, capital
- **Risk**: reversibility, blast radius, optionality
- **Brand Fit**: alignment with existing creative direction

---

## Creative Constraints

- **Emotion:** what should the audience feel?
- **Message:** one sentence takeaway
- **Constraint Set:** palette, style, length, medium, timebox
- **Reference Set:** 3–5 comps for calibration
- **Feedback Loop:** define who, when, and how
- **Existing Assets:** leverage current creative work

---

## Quick Filter

Skip deep work if all are true:

- Low, vague, or misaligned intent
- High effort for marginal value
- Better alternatives exist now
- **Existing creative assets can be repurposed**

→ **Log as intent debt** (record context, revisit trigger).

## Codebase-First Creative Rule

Create using:

1. **Existing brand elements** - leverage current visual language
2. **Proven patterns** - use what's resonated before
3. **Modular assets** - build reusable creative components
4. **Clear constraints** - boundaries enable creativity
5. **Iterative refinement** - start simple, enhance based on feedback

## Priority Matrix

| Impact | Effort | Risk | Brand Fit | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | Low | Low | Strong | **Make a 1‑page or 30‑sec prototype using existing assets** |
| High | Med–High | Med | Strong | **Storyboard → pilot → refine** |
| High | Med–High | Med | Weak | **Evaluate brand alignment first** |
| Med | Low | Low | Strong | **Sketch pack using existing elements, schedule critique** |
| Low | Any | Any | Any | **Archive in idea bank** |
