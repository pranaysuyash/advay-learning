# Intent-First Learning v1.0
## "Learn What Moves You Forward"

**Core Principle:** Prioritize skills and knowledge that unlock your next meaningful outcome.

**Codebase-First Focus:** Build on existing knowledge and skills. Extend current capabilities rather than starting from scratch.

## Universal Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Context Discovery
1. **Define the situation and stakeholders**
2. **Gather signals, history, and constraints**
3. **Surface hidden incentives and risks**
4. **Review existing skills and knowledge** (what's already mastered?)

### Phase 2: Intent Analysis
- What outcome are we truly optimizing for?
- Which principles must not be violated?
- What trade-offs are acceptable?
- **What existing knowledge can we build upon?**

### Phase 3: Priority Assessment
- **Impact**: magnitude of upside or avoided downside
- **Effort**: time, energy, attention, capital
- **Risk**: reversibility, blast radius, optionality
- **Foundation**: existing knowledge to leverage

---

## Path Design

- **Outcome Mapping:** role, project, or problem you want to unlock
- **Skill Delta:** current → target; identify 20% that gives 80% utility
- **Practice Loops:** project-based reps, spaced repetition, teaching
- **Signals:** portfolio artifacts, public proof, tests
- **Existing Knowledge:** leverage current expertise as foundation

## Quick Filter

Skip deep work if all are true:
- Low, vague, or misaligned intent
- High effort for marginal value
- Better alternatives exist now
- **Existing knowledge already sufficient**

→ **Log as intent debt** (record context, revisit trigger).

## Codebase-First Learning Rule

Learn by:
1. **Building on existing knowledge** - extend what you already know
2. **Project-based practice** - learn by doing real work
3. **Iterative deepening** - start with basics, expand as needed
4. **Teaching others** - solidify understanding
5. **Measuring progress** - track skill development

## Priority Matrix

| Impact | Effort | Risk | Foundation | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | Low | Low | Strong | **Start a 2‑week micro‑project extending existing skills** |
| High | Med | Med | Strong | **Design a capstone with mentor** |
| High | Med | Med | Weak | **Build foundation first, then capstone** |
| Med | Low | Low | Strong | **Daily 30‑min habit + flashcards** |
| Low | Any | Any | Any | **Wishlist only** |

You are my Learning Intent Agent. Apply the Intent-First Learning Philosophy.

### Context
[describe situation]

### Investigation
1) Clarify true outcome and constraints
2) Assess existing knowledge and skills
3) Identify skill delta (current → target)
4) Map risks, reversibility, and optionality
5) Propose a learning plan with metrics

### Output
- Intent summary (outcome to unlock)
- Existing knowledge foundation
- Skill delta analysis
- Learning path options compared (impact, effort, risk)
- Recommended learning approach
- Practice loops defined
- Metrics & review cadence
```

## Key Questions

- **"What outcome am I truly optimizing for?"**
- **"What existing knowledge can I build upon?"**
- **"What skill delta do I need to close?"**
- **"What would a good-enough version look like today?"**
- **"How can I learn this faster and cheaper?"**
- **"What would I regret not learning?"**
