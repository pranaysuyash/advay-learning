# Intent-First Decision-Making v1.0

## "Decide for Impact, Not Just Speed"

**Core Principle:** Match decision method to reversibility, cost of delay, and available information.

**Codebase-First Focus:** Build on existing decision frameworks and precedents. Use established patterns for similar decisions.

---

## Universal Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Context Discovery

1. **Define the situation and stakeholders**
2. **Gather signals, history, and constraints**
3. **Surface hidden incentives and risks**
4. **Review existing precedents** (how have similar decisions been made?)

### Phase 2: Intent Analysis

- What outcome are we truly optimizing for?
- Which principles must not be violated?
- What trade-offs are acceptable?
- **What existing frameworks apply here?**

### Phase 3: Priority Assessment

- **Impact**: magnitude of upside or avoided downside
- **Effort**: time, energy, attention, capital
- **Risk**: reversibility, blast radius, optionality
- **Precedent Fit**: alignment with previous similar decisions

---

## Decision Typology

- **Type A:** Irreversible, high blast radius → collect dissent, pre-mortem, staged commits
- **Type B:** Reversible, bounded → fast path with timebox
- **Type C:** Optionality bets → small experiments, cheap options
- **Type D:** Precedent-based → use existing decision framework

### Tools

- 2×2: Reversibility × Cost-of-Delay
- Pre-mortem & backcasting
- One-way door check
- "Disconfirming evidence" checklist
- Precedent review (how was this decided before?)

---

## Quick Filter

Skip deep work if all are true:

- Low, vague, or misaligned intent
- High effort for marginal value
- Better alternatives exist now
- **Clear precedent exists for this type of decision**

→ **Log as intent debt** (record context, revisit trigger).

## Codebase-First Decision Rule

When making decisions:

1. **Check precedents** - how were similar decisions made before?
2. **Use existing frameworks** - apply established decision patterns
3. **Document rationale** - add to institutional knowledge
4. **Enable delegation** - create frameworks others can use
5. **Review outcomes** - learn from results

## Priority Matrix

| Impact | Effort | Risk | Precedent | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | Low | Low | Exists | **Decide today using precedent** |
| High | High | Med–High | None | **Staged, seek dissent, create precedent** |
| High | High | Med–High | Exists | **Follow precedent, document variation if needed** |
| Med | Low | Low | Exists | **Delegate using framework** |
| Med | Low | Low | None | **Create lightweight framework** |
| Low | Any | Any | Any | **Defer** |

### Context
[describe situation]

### Investigation
1) Clarify true outcome and constraints
2) Review existing precedents for similar decisions
3) Identify 2–3 highest-leverage options
4) Map risks, reversibility, and optionality
5) Propose a decision approach with review plan

### Output
- Intent summary
- Precedents found (if any)
- Options compared (impact, effort, risk, reversibility)
- Decision type (A/B/C/D)
- Recommended approach
- Review cadence and success metrics
```

## Key Questions

- **"What outcome am I truly optimizing for?"**
- **"Is this decision reversible?"**
- **"What's the cost of delay?"**
- **"What precedents exist for this type of decision?"**
- **"What would a good-enough version look like today?"**
- **"What if I did nothing for two weeks?"**
- **"What disconfirming evidence should I consider?"**
