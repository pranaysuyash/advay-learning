# Intent-First Wellbeing v1.0

## "Choose Habits for Energy, Not Punishment"

**Core Principle:** Design routines around energy, recovery, and sustainability for your real life.

**Codebase-First Focus:** Build on existing healthy habits. Enhance current routines before adding new ones.

## Universal Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Context Discovery

1. **Define the situation and stakeholders**
2. **Gather signals, history, and constraints**
3. **Surface hidden incentives and risks**
4. **Review existing habits** (what's already working well?)

### Phase 2: Intent Analysis

- What outcome are we truly optimizing for?
- Which principles must not be violated?
- What trade-offs are acceptable?
- **What existing habits can we build upon?**

### Phase 3: Priority Assessment

- **Impact**: magnitude of upside or avoided downside
- **Effort**: time, energy, attention, capital
- **Risk**: reversibility, blast radius, optionality
- **Habit Foundation**: existing routines to leverage

---

## Systems

- **Sleep anchors:** same wake time, light exposure
- **Movement:** minimum viable dose, joyful modalities
- **Nutrition:** defaults, environment design, batch prep
- **Mind:** breathwork, journaling, social connection
- **Health Flags:** labs, pain signals, preventive care
- **Existing Habits:** leverage current routines as anchors

---

## Quick Filter

Skip deep work if all are true:

- Low, vague, or misaligned intent
- High effort for marginal value
- Better alternatives exist now
- **Existing habits already sufficient**

→ **Log as intent debt** (record context, revisit trigger).

## Codebase-First Wellbeing Rule

Build wellbeing by:

1. **Anchoring to existing habits** - attach new habits to current routines
2. **Minimum viable changes** - smallest effective adjustments
3. **Sustainable pace** - changes that can be maintained long-term
4. **Energy management** - prioritize activities that increase energy
5. **Iterative refinement** - adjust based on what works

## Priority Matrix

| Impact | Effort | Risk | Habit Foundation | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | Low | Low | Strong | **Add one anchor habit this week** |
| High | Med | Med | Strong | **30‑day protocol, measure 3 metrics** |
| High | Med | Med | Weak | **Establish one anchor habit first** |
| Med | Low | Low | Strong | **Habit stack after existing routine** |
| Low | Any | Any | Any | **Skip for now** |
