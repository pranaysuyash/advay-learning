# Intent-First Communication v1.0
## "Speak for Understanding, Not Performance"

**Core Principle:** Every message serves a single outcome for a specific audience at a specific moment.

**Codebase-First Focus:** Build on existing communication channels and patterns. Enhance current practices before introducing new ones.

## Universal Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Context Discovery
1. **Define the situation and stakeholders**
2. **Gather signals, history, and constraints**
3. **Surface hidden incentives and risks**
4. **Review existing communication patterns** (what's already working?)

### Phase 2: Intent Analysis
- What outcome are we truly optimizing for?
- Which principles must not be violated?
- What trade-offs are acceptable?
- **How does this fit existing communication norms?**

### Phase 3: Priority Assessment
- **Impact**: magnitude of upside or avoided downside
- **Effort**: time, energy, attention, capital
- **Risk**: reversibility, blast radius, optionality
- **Channel Fit**: alignment with existing communication channels

---

## Mechanics

- **Audience & Desired State:** what should they think, feel, do?
- **One Big Idea:** headline, TL;DR, call-to-action
- **Structure:** Context → Intent → Ask → Next steps
- **Medium:** async, sync, doc, deck, Loom, live
- **Friction:** language, jargon, time zones, accessibility
- **Existing Channels:** leverage current communication patterns

---

## Quick Filter

Skip deep work if all are true:
- Low, vague, or misaligned intent
- High effort for marginal value
- Better alternatives exist now
- **Existing communication already sufficient**

→ **Log as intent debt** (record context, revisit trigger).

## Codebase-First Enhancement Rule

Communicate using:
1. **Existing channels first** - leverage current communication patterns
2. **Established terminology** - use language the team understands
3. **Proven formats** - use structures that have worked before
4. **Clear increments** - one outcome per message
5. **Feedback loops** - ensure understanding

## Priority Matrix

| Impact | Effort | Risk | Channel Fit | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | Low | Low | Strong | **Send now with TL;DR** |
| High | Med | Med | Strong | **Draft, peer review, then send** |
| High | Any | Any | Weak | **Use existing channel or choose appropriate medium** |
| Med | Low | Low | Strong | **Batch or template** |
| Low | Any | Any | Any | **Skip or note** |

### Context
[describe situation]

### Investigation
1) Clarify true outcome and constraints
2) Identify existing communication patterns and channels
3) Identify 2–3 highest-leverage moves
4) Map risks, reversibility, and optionality
5) Propose an incremental action with metrics

### Output
- Intent summary
- Audience & desired state
- One Big Idea (headline)
- Recommended format and channel
- Options compared (impact, effort, risk)
- Metrics & review cadence
```
