# Intent-First Relationships v1.0
## "Understand Before Reacting"

**Core Principle:** Optimize for trust, shared meaning, and compounding goodwill.

**Codebase-First Focus:** Build on existing relationship foundations. Repair and enhance current connections before building new ones.

## Universal Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Context Discovery
1. **Define the situation and stakeholders**
2. **Gather signals, history, and constraints**
3. **Surface hidden incentives and risks**
4. **Review existing relationship foundation** (what trust and history exists?)

### Phase 2: Intent Analysis
- What outcome are we truly optimizing for?
- Which principles must not be violated?
- What trade-offs are acceptable?
- **What existing relationship capital can we draw upon?**

### Phase 3: Priority Assessment
- **Impact**: magnitude of upside or avoided downside
- **Effort**: time, energy, attention, capital
- **Risk**: reversibility, blast radius, optionality
- **Relationship Foundation**: existing trust and goodwill

## Practices

- **Bid detection:** notice small bids for attention/affection
- **Repair loops:** apology → amends → behavior change
- **Conflict hygiene:** steelman, state needs, negotiate boundaries
- **Cadence:** 1:1s, date nights, family rituals, retros
- **Existing Foundation:** leverage current trust and shared history

---

## Quick Filter

Skip deep work if all are true:
- Low, vague, or misaligned intent
- High effort for marginal value
- Better alternatives exist now
- **Existing relationship already strong**

→ **Log as intent debt** (record context, revisit trigger).

## Codebase-First Relationships Rule

Build relationships by:
1. **Maintaining existing connections** - nurture current relationships
2. **Repairing when needed** - address issues promptly
3. **Building trust incrementally** - small consistent actions
4. **Creating shared meaning** - rituals and traditions
5. **Investing in high-value relationships** - focus on what matters

## Priority Matrix

| Impact | Effort | Risk | Foundation | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | Low | Low | Strong | **Have the conversation today** |
| High | Med | Med | Strong | **Mediation or structured 1:1** |
| High | Med | Med | Weak | **Focus on repair and trust-building first** |
| Med | Low | Low | Strong | **Schedule ritual, send note** |
| Low | Any | Any | Any | **Let it pass; note pattern** |
