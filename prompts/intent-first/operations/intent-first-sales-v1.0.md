# Intent-First Sales Philosophy v1.0
## "Qualify for Fit, Not Just Revenue"

**Core Principle:** Before pursuing leads, designing sales processes, or making pricing decisions, investigate whether prospects can actually achieve meaningful success with your product and if the partnership would be mutually beneficial long-term.

**Codebase-First Focus:** Build on existing sales processes. Enhance current pipeline stages before adding new ones.

---

## Universal Investigation Framework

### Phase 1: Context Discovery
1. **Identify the sales opportunity** (inbound lead, outbound prospect, expansion opportunity, or competitive displacement)
2. **Understand prospect situation** (business context, current solutions, and decision-making process)
3. **Assess mutual fit potential** (can our product solve their problem? Can they be successful with us?)
4. **Evaluate relationship dynamics** (decision makers, influencers, and cultural alignment)
5. **Review existing pipeline** (what stage are they in, what's already been done?)

### Phase 2: Fit Analysis
- What specific business problem are they trying to solve and why now?
- Do they have the resources, commitment, and capability to be successful with our solution?
- Is there a clear path to measurable value that justifies our pricing?
- Would this customer become a reference and advocate if successful?
- **Can existing sales processes address their needs?**

### Phase 3: Opportunity Prioritization
- **Success Probability**: Likelihood prospect can achieve meaningful outcomes with our product
- **Revenue Quality**: Deal size, terms, and long-term expansion potential
- **Strategic Value**: Market significance, reference potential, and competitive positioning
- **Sales Efficiency**: Time and resources required to close and onboard successfully
- **Process Fit**: How well do they fit existing sales motion?

## Quick Filter

Minimize sales investment if all true:
- Unclear business problem or weak urgency to solve it
- Limited budget or decision-making authority
- Poor fit between their needs and our product capabilities
- High support requirements with low expansion potential
- **Don't fit existing sales process (high customization needed)**

## Sales Priority Matrix

| Success Probability | Revenue Quality | Strategic Value | Process Fit | Priority |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| High | High | High | Strong | **Critical – Full sales engagement with executive involvement** |
| High | Medium | Medium-High | Strong | **High – Standard sales process with success planning** |
| Medium | High | Medium | Moderate | **Medium – Qualify thoroughly before significant investment** |
| High | High | Low | Strong | **Evaluate resource allocation vs. other opportunities** |
| Low | Any | Any | Weak | **Provide self-service options, minimal sales investment** |

---

## Codebase-First Sales Rule

For *Critical* and *High* priority opportunities:
1. **Follow existing sales process** - use proven pipeline stages
2. **Leverage existing materials** - use current decks, demos, and case studies
3. **Build on successful patterns** - apply what's worked for similar customers
4. **Qualify rigorously** - ensure fit before customizing process
5. **Measure conversion** - track what actually leads to closed deals

Advanced discovery, custom demos, extensive proposal development, and executive engagement can be added based on opportunity qualification and strategic importance.
