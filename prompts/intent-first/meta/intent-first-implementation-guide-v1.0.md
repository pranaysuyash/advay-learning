# Intent-First Implementation Guide v1.0

## Getting Started with Intent-First

### Phase 1: Individual Adoption (Week 1-2)

1. **Choose Your Starting Philosophy**: Pick the area where you feel most immediate pain
2. **Use the AI Prompts**: Start applying the investigation prompts to current decisions
3. **Document Your Decisions**: Begin using the decision matrix and reasoning templates
4. **Track Your Results**: Note how intent-first thinking changes your approach

### Phase 2: Team Integration (Week 3-6)

1. **Share Early Wins**: Demonstrate value from individual adoption
2. **Implement Review Checklists**: Add intent-first questions to existing processes
3. **Start Debt Logs**: Begin tracking deferred decisions systematically
4. **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Include stakeholders in decision frameworks

### Phase 3: Organizational Scaling (Month 2-3)

1. **Establish Success Metrics**: Track quantitative and qualitative improvements
2. **Create Training Materials**: Develop team-specific implementation guides
3. **Integrate with Existing Processes**: Embed intent-first thinking into current workflows
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular retrospectives and process refinement

## Common Implementation Challenges

### Challenge: "This takes too much time"

- **Solution**: Start with Quick Filters to eliminate low-value decisions quickly
- **Remember**: Investment in investigation prevents wasted effort on wrong solutions

### Challenge: "Teams resist changing existing processes"

- **Solution**: Begin with voluntary adoption and demonstrate value before mandating
- **Focus**: Show how intent-first thinking improves outcomes, not just process compliance

### Challenge: "Stakeholders don't understand the framework"

- **Solution**: Use concrete examples and success stories to illustrate benefits
- **Approach**: Start with high-impact, low-controversy decisions to build confidence

### Challenge: "We have too much existing code to apply this"

- **Solution**: Start with new decisions, apply retroactively to critical areas
- **Focus**: Apply codebase-first principle - work with what you have

## Codebase-First Adoption Path

### Week 1-2: Assessment

- Review current codebase and identify areas of technical debt
- Document existing patterns and conventions
- Identify quick wins for enhancement

### Week 3-4: Quick Wins

- Apply intent-first development to small enhancements
- Use existing patterns for new features
- Document decisions made

### Week 5-8: Integration

- Apply intent-first to larger features
- Use decision matrices for significant changes
- Track outcomes

### Month 3+: Optimization

- Refine processes based on learnings
- Share successes with team
- Scale to other areas

## Success Patterns

### What Works Well

- Starting with high-uncertainty decisions
- Using the AI prompts for complex problems
- Documenting rationale for future reference
- Applying the Quick Filter to avoid over-analysis
- Enhancing existing code rather than rewriting

### What to Avoid

- Over-applying to trivial decisions
- Skipping the Context Discovery phase
- Ignoring the Codebase-First principle
- Failing to document decisions
- Not reviewing outcomes
