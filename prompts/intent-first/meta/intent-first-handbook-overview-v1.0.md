# Intent-First Handbook Overview v1.0

## Introduction: The Intent-First Methodology

The Intent-First Methodology transforms how teams make decisions by asking one fundamental question before any action: **"What is the real intent behind this, and will our approach create genuine value?"**

### Adaptation for This Project: Codebase-First

While the original Intent-First methodology emphasizes "MVP thinking," this adapted version focuses on **"Codebase-First"** principles:

- **Work with what's there** - Enhance existing code before starting fresh
- **Build incrementally** - Extend current features rather than replacing
- **Preserve working patterns** - Follow established conventions
- **Add, don't destroy** - Extend functionality before removing old code
- **Document in sync** - Keep docs aligned with current implementation

---

## Core Principles

Every Intent-First philosophy shares these fundamental principles:

1. **Investigate Before Acting** - Always understand the underlying need or problem
2. **Value Over Process** - Focus on outcomes, not just following procedures
3. **Codebase-First Mindset** - Start with existing code, enhance iteratively
4. **Business Alignment** - Connect every decision to business and user value
5. **Systematic Documentation** - Track decisions and learnings for continuous improvement

---

## Universal Framework

Each philosophy follows the same 3-phase investigation framework:

**Phase 1: Context Discovery** - Understand the situation, stakeholders, and current state
**Phase 2: Intent Analysis** - Identify the real problem and desired outcomes
**Phase 3: Priority Assessment** - Evaluate impact, effort, and strategic alignment

- Apply the investigation framework to your daily work
- Reference relevant philosophy for your area

### Team Leads
- Implement the checklists and review processes
- Share the philosophy with your team
- Use for architecture and prioritization decisions

### Organizations

---

## Quick Reference

### The Intent Stack
- **Personal:** values, energy, constraints
- **Team:** shared goals, interfaces, commitments
- **Product:** user value, metrics, roadmap
- **Org:** strategy, culture, capital allocation
- **Ecosystem:** partners, regulation, community

### Intent Check-in Rituals
- **Daily (7 min):** top 1–3 outcomes, one hard thing, one easy win
- **Weekly (30 min):** review metrics, intent debt, next bets
- **Monthly (60 min):** themes, opportunities, stop‑doing list
- **Quarterly (90 min):** narrative update, re-align stack

### Intent-to-Action Loop
Capture → Analyze → Act → Measure → Reflect → Adjust  
Make loops small, frequent, and visible.

### Chaining Intents (example)
Data → Product → Sales → CS → Product.  
Make the handoff artifact a one‑page "Intent Brief" with problem, constraints, metrics, owners.

## Key Concept: Codebase-First

Unlike the original "MVP mindset," this adapted version emphasizes working with existing code:

| MVP Mindset | Codebase-First |
|-------------|----------------|
| Start from scratch | Enhance existing |
| Build new features | Extend current features |
| Replace old code | Preserve working patterns |
| Rapid prototyping | Incremental improvement |
| Validate hypotheses | Build on proven foundation |

### When to Apply Codebase-First
- Existing code is stable and functional
- Current features have user adoption
- Team understands existing patterns
- Time/resources are constrained
- Risk of breaking changes is high

### When to Consider Replacement
- Existing code is fundamentally broken
- Technical debt is unmanageable
- Architecture doesn't support requirements
- Team consensus on replacement
- Business case justifies rewrite
