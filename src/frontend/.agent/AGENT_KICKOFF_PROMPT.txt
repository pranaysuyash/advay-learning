Use sources in this order:
1) learning_for_kids/src/frontend/AGENTS.md (if present)
2) Project-local docs/prompts/worklogs under learning_for_kids/src/frontend
3) learning_for_kids/src/frontend/.agent/SESSION_CONTEXT.md
4) /Users/pranay/Projects/workspace_memory/sources/...

Rules:
- Cite concrete file paths for decisions or constraints.
- If sources conflict, show the conflict and ask before proceeding.
- Prefer latest dated docs when available.
- Append new decisions/worklogs to project docs, then re-run agent-start.
