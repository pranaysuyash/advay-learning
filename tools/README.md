## 🎯 Hand Tracking Latency Analyzer ⭐ PRIMARY TOOL

**Purpose:** Measure MediaPipe hand-tracking accuracy by comparing actual hand position to on-screen pointer/cursor position to detect coordinate system bugs.

**File:** `hand_tracking_latency_analyzer.py`

### Why This Tool is Critical

**The Real Issue:** Most tracking problems aren't missing MediaPipe data, but **coordinate mapping bugs** where hand coordinates don't properly map to screen coordinates.

**Example Discovery:** Found 2000+ pixel offset between hand position and pointer position in Emoji Match game - MediaPipe was working, but coordinate transformation was completely broken.

### Features

- **Hand Detection:** Skin-tone based hand region detection
- **Pointer Detection:** Red color detection for on-screen cursor/pointer
- **Distance Analysis:** Measures pixel distance between hand and pointer
- **Movement Tracking:** Analyzes natural movement patterns
- **Lag Measurement:** Calculates response time delays

### Usage

```bash
# Activate project venv first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run comprehensive latency analysis
python3 tools/hand_tracking_latency_analyzer.py tools/emoji_match.mov tools/latency_report.json

# Results include:
# - Average hand-pointer distance in pixels
# - Lag events and timing
# - Coordinate system issues detection
# - JSON report for detailed analysis
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python numpy`
- Video showing both hand and screen pointer

### Output Format

**Console Report:**
```
🎯 Tracking Performance:
   Avg hand-pointer distance: 2,016.73 px ❌ CRITICAL
   Max hand-pointer distance: 2,786.76 px ❌ CRITICAL
   Lag events: 40/40 (100%)

⚡ Latency Measurements:
   Min latency: 16.9 ms
   Max latency: 84.7 ms
   Avg latency: 42.3 ms

Toddler-friendly rating: ❌ BROKEN - Completely unusable
```

**JSON Report:** Detailed metrics with frame-by-frame tracking data

## 📸 Video Frame Analyzer

**Purpose:** Extract frames for manual UI/UX analysis of game states, transitions, target sizing, and visual feedback issues.

**File:** `video_frame_analyzer.py`

### Features

- **Frame Extraction:** Extract frames at regular intervals for manual analysis
- **Video Metadata:** Get fps, resolution, duration, and ms-per-frame calculations
- **Scene Detection:** Identify game state transitions for pacing analysis
- **UI Element Detection:** Analyze target sizes and spacing

### Usage

```bash
# Activate project venv first
source .venv/bin/activate

# Get video information
python3 tools/video_frame_analyzer.py tools/emoji_match.mov info

# Extract frames at 0.5s intervals (to tools/frames/)
python3 tools/video_frame_analyzer.py tools/emoji_match.mov extract

# Detect scene changes/transitions
python3 tools/video_frame_analyzer.py tools/emoji_match.mov scenes
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV: `pip install opencv-python numpy`
- Video file in project directory

### Output Format

- **JSON metadata:** fps, frame count, duration, resolution, ms_per_frame
- **Extracted frames:** Named as `frame_XXXXXX_tX.XXs.png` with timestamps
- **Scene changes:** Timestamped frames where significant visual changes occur

---

## 📊 Frame Analysis Workflow

### 1. Extract Video Metadata
```bash
python3 tools/video_frame_analyzer.py <video_path> info
```

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "fps": 59.07,
  "frame_count": 7112,
  "duration_seconds": 120.4,
  "resolution": "2798x1986",
  "ms_per_frame": 16.93
}
```

### 2. Extract Frames for Analysis
```bash
python3 tools/video_frame_analyzer.py <video_path> extract
```

**Results:**
- Frames saved to `tools/frames/` directory
- Named with frame numbers and timestamps
- Sample interval: 0.5s (adjustable in code)

### 3. Manual Frame Analysis
Use the extracted frames to identify:
- Hand-tracking cursor visibility (or lack thereof)
- Target sizes relative to screen dimensions
- Game state transitions and pacing
- Success/failure feedback timing
- Instruction clarity and duration

### 4. Generate QA Report
Create detailed audit reports following the UI/UX framework:
- Severity-ranked issues (S1/S2/S3)
- Timestamp-backed evidence
- Child-friendly design principles
- Quick wins vs. deep work recommendations

## 🧒 Kids Game UI/UX QA Framework

### Analysis Focus Areas

1. **Hand-tracking lag**
   - Measure delay between real movement and on-screen response
   - Estimate latency in milliseconds using frame rate
   - Provide timestamp ranges for measurements

2. **Dot/cursor design**
   - Size: Minimum 20-30px diameter for visibility
   - Contrast: ≥4.5:1 ratio against backgrounds
   - Clarity: What it represents and how it behaves

3. **Target sizes**
   - Toddler-appropriate: 15-20% of screen width
   - Hitboxes: 2-3x visible target size
   - Spacing: Minimum 30px between interactive elements

4. **Speed/pacing**
   - State transitions: ≥2-3 seconds for toddler processing
   - Instructions: 5-8 seconds minimum visibility
   - Child-controlled pacing when possible

5. **Clarity of instruction and feedback**
   - Zero text dependency for gameplay
   - Visual demonstrations over text explanations
   - Immediate feedback (<100ms) for all actions

6. **Tracking stability**
   - Jitter assessment (none/low/medium/high)
   - Occlusion handling (hand leaving frame)
   - Recovery from tracking loss

### Toddler Motor Control Guidelines

**Age 2-4 years:**
- **Fine motor skills:** Developing, not precise
- **Target sizes:** Minimum 15-20% of screen width
- **Hitboxes:** 2-3x visible target size
- **Processing time:** 3-5+ seconds for new information
- **Attention span:** Short, needs frequent reinforcement

**Design Principles:**
- One obvious next action at any time
- Forgiving interaction (big targets, generous hitboxes)
- Immediate, clear success feedback
- Gentle failure feedback with fast recovery
- Minimal reading required

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### OpenCV Installation Issues

```bash
# Try alternative installation
pip install opencv-python-headless

# Or use conda
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

### Video File Too Large

The analysis tool extracts frames at intervals, so it works with large files. If you encounter memory issues:

1. Reduce extraction interval (modify `interval_seconds` parameter)
2. Extract specific time ranges only
3. Use video compression before analysis

### Frame Extraction Slow

For faster analysis:
1. Reduce video resolution before processing
2. Extract fewer frames (increase interval)
3. Use SSD for better I/O performance
