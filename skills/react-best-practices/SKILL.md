# Skill: react-best-practices (repo-local)

## What this skill does

Applies a Vercel-aligned React best-practices workflow to this repo’s frontend (`src/frontend`), prioritizing:

1) Async waterfalls
2) Bundle size
3) Wasted rendering / state churn
4) Micro-optimizations (last)

## How to use it in this repo

Use the repo prompt as the single source of truth:

- `prompts/hardening/react-best-practices-v1.0.md`

## Output requirements

- Label claims as **Observed / Inferred / Unknown**
- Provide verification commands + raw outputs
- Keep scope to one hardening slice per change-set
