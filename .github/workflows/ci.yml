# Note: This repository uses local/offline CI checks only.
# GitHub Actions workflows are intentionally not used in this project.
# The original CI workflow was removed to emphasize that checks are run via local scripts
# and the `uv`-managed venv as per AGENTS.md.
# If you still want to enable a GitHub workflow in the future, restore a CI YAML with the
# appropriate steps to install `uv` and run `uv run pytest` and frontend tests.
